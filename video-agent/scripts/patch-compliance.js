/**
 * Prepends an AI Disclosure & Consent preamble to Jordan's persona system_prompt.
 * Fetches the current prompt, prepends the new section at the TOP, and PATCHes
 * it back to Tavus so the disclosure is the first thing Jordan does in every
 * new conversation.
 *
 * Required by:
 *   - Florida SB 482 (AI Bill of Rights — explicit disclosure)
 *   - Illinois Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act (consent)
 *   - NYC Automated Employment Decision Tool rules
 *   - Florida two-party recording consent
 *
 * Run: node scripts/patch-compliance.js
 *
 * Reads TAVUS_API_KEY and TAVUS_STAFFING_PERSONA_ID from .env.
