/**
 * POST /api/staffing/patch-persona
 *
 * One-shot endpoint that PATCHes the existing Jordan persona (via JSON Patch
 * RFC 6902) to attach:
 *   1. The full Raven-1 perception block under /layers/perception
 *   2. The full 11-objective conversation_rules.objectives block under
 *      /conversation_rules/objectives (includes the work_authorization
 *      conditional branch: continue_screening vs end_screening_ineligible)
 *   3. The 4 Jordan guardrails under /conversation_rules/guardrails, with
 *      callback_url pointing at STAFFING_BASE_URL/api/staffing/tools
 *
 * After this runs, Tavus enforces objectives and guardrails at the API level
 * on every new Jordan conversation — not just via system prompt.
 *
 * Run once after deploy:
 *   curl -X POST https://YOUR_DOMAIN/api/staffing/patch-persona
 *
 * Response: { ok, persona_id, patched_fields }
